## :clipboard: How are your responsibilities being covered?

**Customers:**
- How you will be backed up while you are out?

**Shipping:**
- Are any ships occurring for your team during this OOO? [yes/no]
- If yes, what are you doing to ensure your responsibilities will be covered?

## :footprints: Next steps
- [ ] :calendar: Add to Google Calendar
- [ ] :rescue_worker_helmet: Open a Workday OOO request (only non-:us: Hubbers)
- [ ] :speech_balloon: Add a comment to this issue with `/ooo from M/D to M/D`, e.g. `/ooo from 5/16 to 5/20`. This will:
  - :mega: Add your OOO time to [`ooo[bot]`](https://probot.github.io/apps/ooo/) to notify Hubbers that you're on OOO when they mention you in an issue while you're out
  - :chart_with_upwards_trend: Trigger an Actions Workflow to update the [Services schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jaLzkVG3BmV2fPjcKoWPeq6kRXB9Lcpqk28r-DcPeZo/) on your behalf


## :bell: Awareness
